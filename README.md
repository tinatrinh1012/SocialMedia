# JustLikeFacebook

JustLikeFacebook is a full stack web application that imitates a typical social media platform, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Its main functionalities include:
- Log in
- Log out
- Sign up
- Create/edit/delete post
- Like/comment on post
- Follow/unfollow users
- Newsfeed showing following users' posts

The technology stack includes:
- MongoDB for document database
- Node.js Express.js for backend server
- React and TypeScript for frontend client
- Passport passport-local strategy for authentication
- Render for hosting

Through this project, my main goal was to get more hands-on experience with React TypeScript, Node.js/Express.js, and working with document database. I also wanted to learn more about authentication, starting with the "beginner" session based passport-local strategy that authenticates using username and password.

It's ideal to access and use this app in Chrome since other browsers may have certain security settings that are not accounted for in this app. 

You can sign up with a username and password, or quickly check it out with these 2 credentials: 
- username: alice & password: letmein
- username: bob & password: letmein
